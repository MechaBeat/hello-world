My initiation with GitHub

I enjoy working on complicated esoteric challenges that seemingly have no solution.
Sometimes it's fruitless. Other times I learn things about design, myself (technical experience, soft skills etc).
I really enjoy playing with possibilities and entertaining thoughts that may or may not work.
